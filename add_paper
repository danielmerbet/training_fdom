anaerobic decomposition in high soil mositure, more decomposition, fdom is a bi product of decomposition, , they put out color
Anaerobic decompisition is highly important for fdom , it happens the contrary in whne the watet tablte goes down

in feaggh is (swt) goes up , typucal in biological processess, beld shape curves are clearly explain, feagh catchemnt is important, belt shape curve

doc, is related to pulses in DOC, higher concentration when there is less water

more fdom in winter

feaagh starts wash up in the summer

implement:
soil water deficit, from reanalysis calculate and use as a predictor


Feeagh: 255 soil mosture, when low soil mositure you have higher fDOM, the higher leads to lower, because there is no oxygen and then you have anaerobic conditions which do not produce as much DOC as aerobic decomposition 

when soils are very dry,  decomposition stops because it needs water,

if soil is completed dry there is no movement of DOC, 

two competent processess at the same time, it happes clearly in feeagh, not so much in Sau

Feagh: concentration of 10 could be autumn and spring. they are taking integrated signals, related to concentration, dilution, is not a straight forward answer.
